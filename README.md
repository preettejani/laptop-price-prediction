# Laptop Price Prediction

## 1. Project Overview
This repository houses the **Laptop Price Prediction** project—a machine learning initiative designed to predict laptop prices based on hardware configurations and other relevant attributes. The goal is to enable users (consumers, retailers, data scientists) to estimate fair prices using predictive modeling.

## 2. Motivation
Laptop prices fluctuate depending on specifications, brand reputation, operating system, and market trends. A predictive model can:
- Help consumers recognize fair deals.
- Assist sellers or refurbishers in pricing competitively.
- Serve as a practical and educational demonstration of regression modeling.

## 3. Dataset *(To be added)*
Once available, include details such as:
- **Source**: e.g., scraped from Croma
- **Size**: e.g., ~ 500
- **Features**: Brand, Processor, RAM, Storage, Screen Size, GPU, Weight, Operating System, Price, etc.

## 4. Methodology Outline
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** (handling missing data, text cleaning, unit extraction)
2. **Feature Engineering**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 
4. **Model Selection & Training**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge / Lasso Regression
   - Decision Trees / Random Forest
5. **Model Evaluation** (MAE, RMSE, R²)
6. **Deployment** (e.g., via Streamlit, Flask, or web app)

## 5. Installation & Usage *(To be tailored later)*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/preettejani/laptop-price-prediction.git
cd laptop-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
